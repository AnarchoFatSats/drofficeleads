# Backend Team - CRM Lead Transfer System

**Subject:** URGENT: CRM Backend Fix Needed - 100 Leads Ready for Production

## ðŸš¨ **Priority Request**

Our CRM system is **90% complete** and ready for production, but we need backend support to resolve Lambda issues blocking the launch.

**Impact**: Sales team has 100 high-quality leads waiting to go live
**Timeline**: ASAP (estimated 2-4 hours for experienced backend dev)

- âœ… Working transfer scripts (tested and ready)
- âœ… Lambda source code (needs debugging)
- âœ… Frontend (fully deployed and working)

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We Need**

**Primary Issue**: Production Lambda returning "Internal server error"
- **URL**: `https://blyqk7itsc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- **Function**: `cura-genesis-crm-api` (us-east-1)

**Critical Endpoints to Fix**:
1. `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (authentication)
2. `GET /api/v1/leads` (view leads)  
3. `POST /api/v1/leads` (create leads)

**Once Fixed**: Run `python smart_lead_injection_api.py` to upload 100 leads

## ðŸ“‹ **Starting Point**

1. **Extract the ZIP file**
2. **Read**: `BACKEND_TEAM_HANDOFF_COMPLETE.md` (comprehensive guide)
3. **Run**: `./QUICK_START.sh` (overview)
4. **Focus on**: `lambda_function.py` (needs JWT/error handling fixes)

## ðŸ§ª **Test Command**
```bash
curl -X POST https://blyqk7itsc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'
```

**Expected**: JWT token response  
**Current**: `{"message": "Internal server error"}`
